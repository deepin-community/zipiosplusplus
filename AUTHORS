Russel Winder (r.winder@180sw.com) did the work of amending the code to
so as to work with GCC 3.2.1.

Ross Burton (r.burton@180sw.com) transformed zipios++.spec into
zipios++.spec.in and made it more RedHat tradition conformant.

Mark Donszelmann (Mark.Donszelmann@slac.stanford.edu) added gzipoutputstream
and made several fixes for Visual C++ 6.0 and 7.0.

Mike Salvatore (mike.salvatore@canonical.com) found a bug in zipheadio.h and
offered a fix. The code would not check for EOF while reading a Uint32 or
Uint16 value. See the infinite_loop.patch for details about the fix. See
this blog post for details about the discovery of the bug:
